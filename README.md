1. I would fit in my automated tests by manually running them locally before pushing code. This way, I can run tests whenever I want to, and don't risk missing a bug until pushing the code, when it may be difficult to go back and fix it. When done correctly, this also ensures that all the code that is pushed has passed all tests.
2. No, I would not use E2E Testing to check if a function is returning the correct output.
3. No. The message feature of a messaging application has many factors that would be difficult to unit test on a large scale. Changing other features of the app would likely affect the test and it would be hard to narrow down the cause of the test failing.
4. Yes. Max message length is a small function that would be easy and useful to implement a unit test for. A unit test would make it easy to identify if the function is implemented incorrectly.
